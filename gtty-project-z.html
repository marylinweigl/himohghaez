What do you guys think will be in Dragon Ball: Project Z? Personally, here's what I would want. In the base package, I expect everything from Raditz to Buu. However, I believe that there will be DLC for the game to continue the story. For Dragon Ball Super, I believe that it will be split into two DLC packs. In the first pack for super, it should be everything from Battle of Gods to Universe 6. The second pack can contain everything from Goku Black to DBS: Broly. What do you guys think. An all you can eat Zombie Fest! Project Z style‚Ä¶ time to get hacking as your survivors take on the horde in a fight to survive deal! Project Z Plus‚Ä¶. Determination, Despair, and Hope -- Discover the story of the mysterious Dragon Balls in the all-new DRAGON BALL GAME - PROJECT Z! #DragonBallZ #Videogames. I have really high hopes that this is going to be one of the best DB games Relive the thrilling adventure of Goku, the Saiyan known as Kakarot recounting the beloved story of Dragon Ball Z like never before. Just Z? Z + Movies? DB + Z? All they way up to Super? Super + GT? Everything? I think I'll take somewhere in the realm of Z + movies and all the way up to Super be it the ToP or Broly. GT would be nice though. Find album reviews, stream songs, credits and award information for Project Z - Project Z on AllMusic - 2001 - Imagine what would result from a recording‚Ä¶. 
The trailer makes it seems as though the game is only going up to the Namek arc and skipping the rest of Z, however at the the end of the trailer Goku is standing on the hill overlooking the city yet this Gi has no symbols on it. If I remember correctly Goku only wore a Gi like that past the namek arc during cell and Buu. Sooo maybe the game is actually gonna go all the way to the Buu arc or it stops at cell like burst limit.

Hey guys so I'm sure most of you are also hyped for this game as I am, but I wanted to discuss what you guys think the game will be like, what you can do, where you can go, who you'll meet, the missions and etc. I just hope this is an amazing RPG with so many missions, so many sidequests, so many interactions with other DBZ characters, new random characters, starting off as Goku as a kid, flying with the nimbus with his pole kicking ass, then later on growing up, learning

I hope so, two of my favorite events. The Project Z timepieces, launched in 2004, embody a highly technically demanding approach and project the same inimitable aura of masterful technical achievement with next-generation materials and design. So I just bought my ticket to project z and super stoked since not only is it cheap but someone told me it's alot of hardstyle and headbanging. Anyone here been before and like to inform me on what to expect? I'm super stoked nontheless about it and can't. Back in late 2015, Warlorder & writer Ricard Fortun asked Warlorder Gabrio if he could help on the Project Z game. Scenery was the order Ik the lineup isn‚Äôt out yet but which basscon djs do y‚Äôall think will be there. 
Survive Surviving isn't just about blowing off zombie heads. Depression, starvation, loneliness, illness, insanity. These are just some of the things you have to deal with‚Ä¶. I was wondering, what can we expect from this? I honestly don't know. Can this be like the GBA Legacy of Goku games? It is an Action RPG game for the consoles (Xbox One, PS4 and PC). Will the character you will play as only be Goku? That would be limiting. Will you fight enemies real time or turn based? I really think the former Will you go to a different screen in order to fight enemies or is it all in the same screen? Will this end only at Frieza or will it include more of the plot? Pleas.
